## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with Harvardâ€™s Programmingâ€¯Languages and Formalâ€¯Methods groups [oai_citation:0â€¡pl.seas.harvard.edu](https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/) and the **Basisâ€¯Researchâ€¯Institute** [oai_citation:1â€¡Basis](https://www.basis.ai/about/).

I completed my PhD at the **Universityâ€¯ofâ€¯Melbourne** [oai_citation:2â€¡Computing School](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), where I built neuroâ€‘symbolic techniques that uses graph-based representation for neural networks for program analysis. Earlier, I spent 4 years at **Cinnamon AI Lab** working on visually rich document information extraction.

I enjoy building learningâ€‘aware tools that treat code as both data and logic. My work lies at the intersection of software engineering, programming languages, and machine learning, coupling **graph-based representation, large language models, and symbolic reasoning** to make software development and formal proof more reliable and automated.

Recent highlights:  
* **VRDSynth for visually rich documents** (ISSTAâ€¯â€™24) [oai_citation:8â€¡ISSTA 2024](https://2024.issta.org/details/issta-2024-papers/57/VRDSynth-Synthesizing-Programs-for-Multilingual-Visually-Rich-Document-Information-E)  
* **GNNâ€‘based faultâ€¯localisation** (ICSMEâ€¯â€™22) [oai_citation:6â€¡SOAR](https://soarsmu.github.io/papers/2022/ICSME_FFL.pdf)  

At Harvard, I am extending these ideas to proof automation in **Lean** and discovering drug repurposing candidates.
At Basis, I am working on two projects: [MARA](https://www.basis.ai/blog/mara/) and [R-ADA](https://www.basis.ai/our-work/r-ada/)

### Research interests  
- Graphâ€‘based analyses for code and proofs  
- Large language models as abstraction engines for program & proof synthesis  
- Neuroâ€‘symbolic methods that couple **Graphs, Neural Networks, SMT, and LLMs**  
- Explainability & robustness for ML models on code
