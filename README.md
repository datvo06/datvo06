## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with [Harvardâ€™s Programmingâ€¯Languages and Formalâ€¯Methods groups](https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Basisâ€¯Researchâ€¯Institute](https://www.basis.ai/about/).

I submitted my PhD thesis at the [Universityâ€¯ofâ€¯Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), where I built neuroâ€‘symbolic techniques that uses graph-based representation for neural networks for program analysis. Earlier, I spent 4 years at **Cinnamon AI Lab** working on visually rich document information extraction.

I enjoy building learningâ€‘aware tools that treat code as both data and logic. My work lies at the intersection of software engineering, programming languages, and machine learning, coupling **graph-based representation, large language models, and symbolic reasoning** to make software development and formal proof more reliable and automated.

At Harvard, I am extending these ideas to proof automation in **Lean** and discovering drug repurposing candidates.
At Basis, I am working on two projects: [MARA](https://www.basis.ai/blog/mara/) and [R-ADA](https://www.basis.ai/our-work/r-ada/)
