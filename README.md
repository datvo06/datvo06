## Hi!



I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with [Harvard’s Programming Languages and Formal Methods groups](https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Basis Research Institute](https://www.basis.ai/about/).

I submitted my PhD thesis at the [University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), where I built neuro‑symbolic techniques that uses graph-based representation for neural networks for program analysis. Earlier, I worked at **Cinnamon AI Lab** working on visually rich document information extraction.

I build tools that treat code as both data and logic. I aim to make software development and formal proof more reliable and automated.

At Harvard, I am extending these ideas to proof automation in **Lean** and discovering drug repurposing candidates.
At Basis, I am working on two projects: [MARA](https://www.basis.ai/blog/mara/) and [R-ADA](https://www.basis.ai/our-work/r-ada/)
