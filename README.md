## Hi!



I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with [Harvard’s Programming Languages and Formal Methods groups](https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Basis Research Institute](https://www.basis.ai/about/). I build tools that treat code as both data and logic. I aim to make software development and formal proof more reliable and automated.
I am extending these ideas to proof automation in **Lean** and discovering drug repurposing candidates and I am working on two projects: [MARA](https://www.basis.ai/blog/mara/) and [R-ADA](https://www.basis.ai/our-work/r-ada/)

I obtained my PhD from the [University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) in analyzing neural networks for program analysis and program synthesis. Previously, I worked at Cinnamon AI Lab, working on visually rich document information extraction.
